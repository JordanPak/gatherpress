# Event Query block

GatherPress includes a block-variation of the `core/query` block, called _Event Query_. This block allows for everything a normal query block can do including the following:

1. Allows endless customisation in terms of layout & style, incl. the use of interactive blocks.
2. Allows editors to select from explicit compositions of block-patterns directly via the blocks **Choose (layout)** button and the **Replace** button in the top toolbar.
3. Allows editors to choose starter-content via the blocks **Start blank** button and the underlying [Block Variation Picker](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages/block-editor/src/components/block-variation-picker).
4. Allows to query either **past or upcoming events**.
5. Allows to select for the inclusion or exclusion of **started, but not yet finished, events**.
6. If used within a `gatherpress_event` post, an editor can choose to **"Exclude** (the) **current Event"**
7. Allows for **custom ordering** (`ORDER BY`) of the events by:
   - datetime (default)
   - random
   - title
   - post_id
   - last modified date
8. ... in either ASC or DESC `ORDER`
9. Allows to filter the queried events by Author, Keyword, Topic or Venue (and any other additionally registered taxonomies).
10. The variation is automatically loaded, when an editor chooses the „Event“ post type in a regular `core/query` block.
