# Update your privacy policy

Inform your visitors about GatherPress\' use of third-party services.

>Every plugin that collects, uses, or stores user data, or passes it to an external source or third party, should add a section of suggested text to the privacy policy postbox. This is best done with `wp_add_privacy_policy_content( $plugin_name, $policy_text )`.
>
>This will allow site administrators to pull that information into their siteâ€™s privacy policy.

GatherPress is following this best-practice and offers some text suggestions, you may want to add to your privacy policy. This makes it easy to copy & paste the relevant snippets into your policy.

With the help of contributors this prepared text may even be already translated into your language.
